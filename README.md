# Welcome to DEV_LinkTree Repository

My project **Dev_LinkTree** allows its user to share all their links in 1 single page to anyone all around the globe.
<br>
Along with this,

* If user uses **Dev.to**, all the person's blogs are automatically shown as one of the links.

* If user uses **Github**, all the person's hosted projects(link made available in website option) is shown via single link.

The user can add/delete the links they created with secure logins.

The main **aim** of my project is to help the user organize their portfolio with their blogs/projects all in one place.
